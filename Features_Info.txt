NOTES

Many of the STD features have 0 values and missing values. If missing value has no relation with the target variable, then it 
would be wise to remove the feature itself due to redundancy.


Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.
